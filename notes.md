### Authentication and Authorization in Backend Engineering and Node.js Development

In backend engineering, **authentication** and **authorization** are two fundamental concepts essential for securing applications. They work together to control access to resources, but they serve distinct purposes. Below is a detailed explanation of each, focusing on their roles in backend development using Node.js.

---

### **1. Authentication**
**Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system trying to access an application. It answers the question, **"Who are you?"**

#### Key Aspects:
- **Purpose**: Confirm that the user is who they claim to be.
- **Implementation in Node.js**:
  - Typically involves user credentials like username/email and password.
  - Tools like **bcrypt** are often used to securely hash and compare passwords.
  - Tokens (e.g., JWT - JSON Web Tokens) are frequently employed for session management.
- **Flow**:
  1. The user provides credentials (e.g., login form).
  2. The backend verifies these credentials by checking a database.
  3. If valid, the backend creates a session or issues a token for the user.

#### Example in Node.js:
```javascript
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

// Sample user data
const users = [{ id: 1, username: 'user1', password: '$2b$10$hashedPasswordHere' }];

// Login route
app.post('/login', async (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;
  const user = users.find(u => u.username === username);

  if (!user) return res.status(404).json({ message: 'User not found' });

  const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);
  if (!isMatch) return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid credentials' });

  const token = jwt.sign({ id: user.id, username: user.username }, 'secretKey', { expiresIn: '1h' });
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Logged in', token });
});
```

#### Common Tools in Node.js:
- **bcrypt**: For password hashing.
- **jsonwebtoken (JWT)**: For creating and verifying tokens.
- **Passport.js**: Middleware for handling authentication strategies like OAuth, Google, Facebook, etc.
- **OAuth2**: A protocol for token-based authentication.

---

### **2. Authorization**
**Authorization** is the process of determining what actions or resources an authenticated user is permitted to access. It answers the question, **"What are you allowed to do?"**

#### Key Aspects:
- **Purpose**: Control access to specific resources based on user roles or permissions.
- **Implementation in Node.js**:
  - Often involves roles (e.g., admin, user) or permission levels assigned to users.
  - Middleware functions are commonly used to restrict access to certain routes.
- **Flow**:
  1. Once a user is authenticated, their token or session is checked to identify roles/permissions.
  2. The backend decides if the user is authorized to perform the requested action or access a resource.
  3. If authorized, the request proceeds; otherwise, an error response is returned.

#### Example in Node.js:
```javascript
const verifyToken = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
  if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Access denied' });

  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, 'secretKey');
    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(403).json({ message: 'Invalid token' });
  }
};

const checkAdmin = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.user.role !== 'admin') {
    return res.status(403).json({ message: 'You are not authorized' });
  }
  next();
};

// Protected route
app.get('/admin', verifyToken, checkAdmin, (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Welcome, admin' });
});
```

#### Common Tools in Node.js:
- **JWT**: Used to encode user roles or permissions into tokens.
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Defines roles and permissions explicitly.
- **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)**: Determines access based on attributes like location, time, etc.

---

### **Key Differences**
| **Aspect**          | **Authentication**                     | **Authorization**                    |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Verify identity                        | Define permissions and access levels |
| **Question Answered**| "Who are you?"                         | "What can you do?"                   |
| **When Used**        | Before authorization                   | After authentication                 |
| **Involves**         | Credentials (e.g., username, password) | Roles, permissions, access rules     |
| **Tools**            | bcrypt, Passport.js, JWT               | JWT, role-based middleware           |

---

### **Best Practices**
1. **Never store passwords in plain text**: Always hash passwords using libraries like bcrypt.
2. **Use HTTPS**: Protect sensitive data during transmission.
3. **Secure tokens**:
   - Store them securely (e.g., HttpOnly cookies).
   - Set expiration times.
4. **Implement role-based access control (RBAC)**:
   - Define roles and map permissions clearly.
   - Use middleware to enforce these rules.
5. **Log user activities**:
   - Monitor failed login attempts.
   - Track unauthorized access attempts.
6. **Regularly update dependencies**:
   - Stay updated with security patches for libraries like bcrypt and JWT.

---

### Summary
- **Authentication** ensures that users are who they claim to be, and it is typically the first step in securing a backend application.
- **Authorization** ensures users can only access resources or perform actions they are allowed to.
- In Node.js development, these processes are often implemented using tools like bcrypt for secure password management and JWT for managing authentication and authorization tokens.

### **What Are Cookies?**

Cookies are small pieces of data stored on a user's browser by a website or server. They are used to store information that can persist between HTTP requests and are essential for managing state in stateless protocols like HTTP. In backend and Node.js development, cookies are a key tool for implementing user sessions, authentication, personalization, and more.

---

### **Structure of a Cookie**

A cookie is a key-value pair with optional attributes. A typical cookie might look like this:
```
userId=12345; Expires=Wed, 29 Jan 2025 12:00:00 GMT; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly
```

#### **Key Components:**
1. **Key-Value Pair**: `userId=12345`
   - Represents the actual data being stored.
2. **Attributes**:
   - **`Expires`**: Specifies the expiry date and time of the cookie.
   - **`Max-Age`**: Similar to `Expires`, but sets the lifetime in seconds.
   - **`Path`**: Defines the URL path for which the cookie is valid (e.g., `/admin`).
   - **`Domain`**: Specifies the domain the cookie belongs to (e.g., `.example.com`).
   - **`Secure`**: Ensures the cookie is sent only over HTTPS.
   - **`HttpOnly`**: Prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie, mitigating XSS attacks.
   - **`SameSite`**: Controls cross-site cookie behavior:
     - `Strict`: Only sent with requests to the same site.
     - `Lax`: Sent with same-site requests and top-level navigations.
     - `None`: Sent with all requests, requires `Secure` in cross-site contexts.

---

### **Use Cases of Cookies in Backend Development**

1. **Session Management**:
   - Storing session IDs to track logged-in users.
2. **Authentication**:
   - Storing authentication tokens like JWT.
3. **User Preferences**:
   - Saving language settings, theme preferences, or shopping cart items.
4. **Tracking**:
   - Used by analytics tools to track user behavior across pages.

---

### **How Cookies Work in HTTP**

1. **Server Sets the Cookie**:
   - The server includes a `Set-Cookie` header in its HTTP response:
     ```
     Set-Cookie: userId=12345; Expires=Wed, 29 Jan 2025 12:00:00 GMT; Path=/; Secure
     ```

2. **Browser Stores the Cookie**:
   - The browser stores the cookie and sends it with subsequent requests to the same domain.

3. **Browser Sends the Cookie**:
   - The browser includes the cookie in the `Cookie` header of future requests:
     ```
     Cookie: userId=12345
     ```

---

### **Using Cookies in Node.js**

#### **1. Installing Middleware**
Use `cookie-parser` to simplify cookie handling:
```bash
npm install cookie-parser
```

#### **2. Setting Up the Middleware**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');

const app = express();
app.use(cookieParser());
```

#### **3. Setting a Cookie**
```javascript
app.get('/set-cookie', (req, res) => {
  res.cookie('userId', '12345', {
    maxAge: 86400000, // 1 day in milliseconds
    httpOnly: true,   // Prevents JavaScript access
    secure: true,     // Ensures it is sent only over HTTPS
    sameSite: 'Strict' // Prevents cross-site request forgery
  });
  res.send('Cookie has been set!');
});
```

#### **4. Reading Cookies**
```javascript
app.get('/read-cookie', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.cookies.userId; // Access cookies from the request
  if (userId) {
    res.send(`User ID from cookie: ${userId}`);
  } else {
    res.send('No userId cookie found.');
  }
});
```

#### **5. Deleting a Cookie**
```javascript
app.get('/delete-cookie', (req, res) => {
  res.clearCookie('userId'); // Deletes the cookie
  res.send('Cookie has been deleted.');
});
```

---

### **Cookies in Authentication and Session Management**

1. **Session Cookies**:
   - Temporary cookies that expire when the browser is closed.
   - Often used to store session identifiers.

2. **Persistent Cookies**:
   - Remain valid for a specified duration (via `Expires` or `Max-Age`).
   - Useful for "Remember Me" functionality.

3. **HttpOnly Cookies for Security**:
   - Used to store sensitive data like session tokens or JWT.
   - Mitigates risks of XSS attacks as JavaScript cannot access these cookies.

---

### **Security Considerations with Cookies**

1. **XSS Protection**:
   - Use `HttpOnly` to prevent JavaScript access.
   - Sanitize user input to avoid injection.

2. **CSRF Protection**:
   - Use the `SameSite` attribute to restrict cross-site usage.
   - Implement anti-CSRF tokens for added security.

3. **Secure Cookies**:
   - Set the `Secure` flag to ensure cookies are transmitted over HTTPS only.

4. **Avoid Storing Sensitive Data**:
   - Never store passwords or sensitive information in cookies.
   - Use tokens or session identifiers instead.

---

### **Advantages of Cookies**

1. **Persistence**:
   - Can store data across multiple browser sessions.
2. **Ease of Use**:
   - Automatically sent with HTTP requests to the server.
3. **Customizability**:
   - Flexible attributes to control behavior.
4. **Wide Support**:
   - Supported by all modern browsers.

---

### **Limitations of Cookies**

1. **Size Limitation**:
   - Cookies are limited to 4KB of data.
2. **Bandwidth Overhead**:
   - Cookies are sent with every request, which can increase bandwidth usage.
3. **Security Concerns**:
   - Vulnerable to XSS and CSRF if not handled properly.

---

### **Alternatives to Cookies**

1. **LocalStorage/SessionStorage**:
   - Store client-side data without sending it to the server.
   - Limited to browser scope and not sent with HTTP requests.

2. **Token-Based Authentication**:
   - Use JWT stored in localStorage or as a `HttpOnly` cookie for authentication.

---

### **Summary**
In Node.js backend development, cookies play a vital role in managing state, sessions, and authentication. By combining cookies with middleware like `cookie-parser` and implementing security best practices, developers can build robust, user-friendly, and secure web applications.

### JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in Node.js and Backend Development

**JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** are a compact, URL-safe way to represent claims between two parties. In backend development, JWTs are widely used for authentication, session management, and information exchange.

---

### **What is a JWT?**
A JWT is a token that securely transmits information between parties as a JSON object. It is **digitally signed** using a secret (HMAC) or public/private key pair (RSA or ECDSA). Because of the signature, the information in the token can be verified for integrity and authenticity.

---

### **Structure of a JWT**
A JWT consists of three parts, separated by dots (`.`):
1. **Header**:
   - Contains metadata about the token.
   - Encoded in Base64Url format.

   Example:
   ```json
   {
     "alg": "HS256", // Algorithm used for signing
     "typ": "JWT"    // Token type
   }
   ```

2. **Payload**:
   - Contains the claims or data being transmitted.
   - Also encoded in Base64Url format.
   - Common claim types:
     - **Registered claims**: Standardized fields like `iss` (issuer), `exp` (expiration), `sub` (subject), etc.
     - **Public claims**: Custom fields, e.g., `userId`, `role`.
     - **Private claims**: Specific to the application.

   Example:
   ```json
   {
     "userId": 123,
     "role": "admin",
     "iat": 1672492800, // Issued at (UNIX timestamp)
     "exp": 1672579200  // Expiration time
   }
   ```

3. **Signature**:
   - Ensures the token’s integrity and authenticity.
   - Created by encoding the header and payload, then signing them with a secret or private key.
   - Signature = `HMACSHA256(base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload), secret)`

   Example:
   ```
   eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEyMywicm9sZSI6ImFkbWluIiwiaWF0IjoxNjcyNDkyODAwLCJleHAiOjE2NzI1NzkyMDB9.abc123SignatureHere
   ```

---

### **How JWTs Work**
1. **Token Issuance**:
   - The client (e.g., frontend) sends login credentials to the backend.
   - If valid, the backend generates a JWT, signs it, and sends it to the client.

2. **Token Storage**:
   - The client stores the JWT securely (e.g., in localStorage, sessionStorage, or HttpOnly cookies).

3. **Token Verification**:
   - For protected routes, the client sends the JWT in the HTTP header (commonly in the `Authorization` header: `Bearer <token>`).
   - The backend verifies the token’s signature and extracts the payload.

4. **Token Usage**:
   - The backend uses the payload information (e.g., `userId`, `role`) to authorize access or perform operations.

---

### **Using JWT in Node.js**

#### **Installation**
Install the `jsonwebtoken` library:
```bash
npm install jsonwebtoken
```

#### **Generating a Token**
Use the `jsonwebtoken` library to generate a token:
```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

// Secret key
const SECRET_KEY = 'yourSecretKey';

// Generate a token
const user = { id: 1, username: 'exampleUser' };
const token = jwt.sign(user, SECRET_KEY, { expiresIn: '1h' });

console.log('Generated Token:', token);
```

#### **Verifying a Token**
Verify the token to ensure it is valid:
```javascript
const verifyToken = (token) => {
  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, SECRET_KEY);
    console.log('Decoded Token:', decoded);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Invalid Token:', err.message);
  }
};

// Example usage
verifyToken(token);
```

#### **Protecting Routes with Middleware**
Implement middleware to secure routes:
```javascript
const authenticateJWT = (req, res, next) => {
  const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;

  if (authHeader) {
    const token = authHeader.split(' ')[1]; // Bearer <token>

    jwt.verify(token, SECRET_KEY, (err, user) => {
      if (err) return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Forbidden' });

      req.user = user; // Attach user data to the request object
      next();
    });
  } else {
    res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' });
  }
};

// Protect this route
app.get('/protected', authenticateJWT, (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Access granted', user: req.user });
});
```

---

### **When to Use JWT**
- **Stateless Authentication**:
  - Suitable for stateless systems where session storage on the server is not desired.
- **Microservices**:
  - Tokens can be shared across services without a centralized session store.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**:
  - JWT is ideal for SSO systems since it can store multiple claims in a compact format.

---

### **Advantages of JWT**
1. **Compact**:
   - Small size; easy to transmit in headers or cookies.
2. **Stateless**:
   - No server-side storage needed for session data.
3. **Secure**:
   - Digital signature ensures integrity and authenticity.
4. **Cross-domain**:
   - Easily used across different domains or microservices.
5. **Customizable**:
   - Flexible payload to include application-specific claims.

---

### **Challenges of JWT**
1. **Revocation**:
   - Stateless nature makes revoking tokens complex.
   - Solutions include short expiration times or maintaining a token blacklist.
2. **Token Size**:
   - Larger than session cookies, which can impact performance in some cases.
3. **Security**:
   - Sensitive data in the payload should not include secrets (e.g., passwords).
   - Always use HTTPS to prevent token interception.
4. **Expiration Handling**:
   - Tokens must be refreshed periodically to avoid expired tokens causing user inconvenience.

---

### **Best Practices**
1. **Secure the Secret Key**:
   - Use strong keys and store them in `.env` files or secret managers.
2. **Use Short Expiry Times**:
   - Minimize token lifetime to reduce the risk of misuse.
3. **Implement Refresh Tokens**:
   - Allow users to get new tokens without logging in again.
4. **Use HttpOnly Cookies**:
   - Protect tokens from XSS attacks by storing them in cookies that cannot be accessed via JavaScript.
5. **Validate Algorithm**:
   - Ensure the algorithm in the header matches your server's expected signing method.
6. **Avoid Sensitive Data in Payload**:
   - Do not store passwords or sensitive PII in the token.

---

### **Summary**
In Node.js backend development, JWT is a powerful tool for authentication and authorization. Its stateless nature and compact format make it ideal for modern, scalable applications. By adhering to best practices and leveraging libraries like `jsonwebtoken`, developers can securely manage user sessions and access control.

**Role-Based Authentication** and **Bearer Token Authentication** are essential concepts in building secure Node.js/Express.js applications. Here's a detailed explanation:

---

### **Role-Based Authentication**
Role-based authentication is a technique to control access to specific resources or operations in your application based on a user's role. This ensures that users can only perform actions or access data permitted by their assigned roles.

#### **How It Works:**
1. **Assign Roles:** Each user is assigned a role, such as `admin`, `user`, `editor`, etc.
2. **Define Permissions:** Each role has a set of permissions that determine what actions the user can perform.
3. **Check Role:** Before performing an operation, the server checks the user's role to ensure they have the required permissions.

#### **Implementation in Node.js/Express.js:**
- Store the user's role in the database (e.g., `admin`, `user`).
- Include the role in the payload of a JWT token after login.
- Use middleware to check the user's role before granting access to protected routes.

#### **Example:**
```javascript
function roleMiddleware(requiredRole) {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    if (req.userInfo.role !== requiredRole) {
      return res.status(403).json({ message: "Access denied" });
    }
    next();
  };
}

// Example usage:
app.get("/admin", authMiddleware, roleMiddleware("admin"), (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "Welcome, Admin!" });
});
```

---

### **Bearer Token Authentication**
Bearer token authentication uses a token (commonly a JWT) to authenticate users. This token is sent with each request to verify the user's identity and grant access to protected resources.

#### **How It Works:**
1. **User Login:**
   - The user logs in with their credentials.
   - The server validates the credentials and generates a token (usually a JWT).
   - The token contains encoded information about the user (e.g., ID, role) and is signed with a secret key.
2. **Token Storage:**
   - The client stores the token (e.g., in localStorage, sessionStorage, or an HTTP-only cookie).
3. **Authenticated Requests:**
   - The client sends the token in the `Authorization` header with each request:
     ```
     Authorization: Bearer <token>
     ```
   - The server decodes and verifies the token to authenticate the user.

#### **Why Use Bearer Tokens?**
- Stateless: No need to maintain session state on the server.
- Scalable: Ideal for distributed systems like microservices.
- Secure: JWTs can be signed and optionally encrypted.

#### **Example:**
```javascript
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");

async function authMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  const authHeader = req.headers["authorization"];
  const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(" ")[1];
  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: "No token provided" });
  }

  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET_KEY);
    req.userInfo = decoded;
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: "Invalid token" });
  }
}
```

### **Differences Between Role-Based and Bearer Token Authentication**

| **Aspect**                  | **Role-Based Authentication**               | **Bearer Token Authentication**            |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                 | Controls what users can do based on roles. | Verifies the user's identity.              |
| **Focus**                   | Authorization                              | Authentication                             |
| **Data Used**               | User roles and permissions.                | Token containing user information.         |
| **Common Use Case**          | Access control for specific routes/actions.| Authenticate API requests.                 |
| **Implementation**          | Middleware checks user roles.              | Middleware validates the token.            |

---

### **Best Practices:**
1. **Use HTTPS:** Always secure token transmission.
2. **Set Expiry:** Tokens should have a short lifespan (e.g., 1 hour).
3. **Refresh Tokens:** Implement a mechanism to issue new tokens without requiring re-login.
4. **Role Hierarchy:** Define a clear hierarchy to simplify role-based permissions.
5. **Avoid Sensitive Data in Tokens:** Do not store passwords or sensitive information in JWT payloads.

This combination of **role-based authentication** and **bearer tokens** provides a secure and scalable approach to user management in modern web applications.

### **What is Multer?**

**Multer** is a Node.js middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, which is primarily used for file uploads. It is a part of the `Express` ecosystem and makes it simple to process incoming files sent by clients in forms or API requests.

When a client sends a file to a server, the request contains both the file and metadata in the form of `multipart/form-data`. Multer extracts these files and metadata, parses them, and makes them available as part of the request object in Express.

---

### **Key Features of Multer**
1. **Efficient Handling:** Handles file uploads efficiently by storing them either in memory or on disk.
2. **Customizable Storage:** Allows developers to specify where and how files should be stored.
3. **File Filtering:** Provides filtering mechanisms (e.g., by file type or size).
4. **Easy Integration:** Works seamlessly with Express routes.

---

### **Installing Multer**
To install Multer, use the following command:
```bash
npm install multer
```

---

### **How to Use Multer in Node.js/Express.js**
Multer requires you to define a storage strategy and use it as middleware in your route. Here’s a step-by-step explanation:

#### 1. **Import Multer**
```javascript
const multer = require("multer");
```

#### 2. **Set Up Storage**
You can configure storage either on disk (file system) or in memory. Below are the two common options:

**Disk Storage:**
Stores files on your server's disk.
```javascript
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, "uploads/"); // Directory to save files
  },
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, Date.now() + "-" + file.originalname); // Unique file name
  },
});
```

**Memory Storage:**
Stores files in memory as Buffer objects.
```javascript
const storage = multer.memoryStorage();
```

#### 3. **Configure Multer Middleware**
Create an upload instance with storage and additional options:
```javascript
const upload = multer({
  storage: storage, // Specify storage
  limits: { fileSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024 }, // Limit file size to 5MB
  fileFilter: (req, file, cb) => {
    if (file.mimetype === "image/jpeg" || file.mimetype === "image/png") {
      cb(null, true); // Accept files
    } else {
      cb(new Error("Only JPEG and PNG files are allowed!"), false); // Reject files
    }
  },
});
```

#### 4. **Use Multer Middleware in Routes**
Use the `upload` middleware in your routes to handle file uploads.

**Single File Upload:**
```javascript
app.post("/upload", upload.single("profilePic"), (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.file); // File metadata
  res.send("File uploaded successfully!");
});
```

**Multiple File Uploads:**
```javascript
app.post("/uploads", upload.array("photos", 5), (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.files); // Array of file metadata
  res.send("Files uploaded successfully!");
});
```

**Field-Specific Uploads:**
For different fields in the same form:
```javascript
app.post(
  "/uploadfields",
  upload.fields([
    { name: "avatar", maxCount: 1 },
    { name: "gallery", maxCount: 5 },
  ]),
  (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.files); // Object with field names as keys
    res.send("Files uploaded successfully!");
  }
);
```

#### 5. **Serve Static Files**
Make uploaded files accessible via a URL:
```javascript
app.use("/uploads", express.static("uploads"));
```

---

### **Multer File Object**
When a file is uploaded, Multer adds it to the `req.file` (for single uploads) or `req.files` (for multiple uploads) object. This contains metadata such as:
```json
{
  "fieldname": "profilePic",
  "originalname": "photo.jpg",
  "encoding": "7bit",
  "mimetype": "image/jpeg",
  "destination": "uploads/",
  "filename": "1674623843421-photo.jpg",
  "path": "uploads/1674623843421-photo.jpg",

### **Integration with Cloud Storage**
You can use Multer with cloud storage services like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Cloudinary by setting up custom storage engines.

**Example with Cloudinary:**
```javascript
const cloudinary = require("cloudinary").v2;
const { CloudinaryStorage } = require("multer-storage-cloudinary");

cloudinary.config({
  cloud_name: process.env.CLOUD_NAME,
  api_key: process.env.API_KEY,
  api_secret: process.env.API_SECRET,
});

const storage = new CloudinaryStorage({
  cloudinary: cloudinary,
  params: {
    folder: "uploads",
    allowed_formats: ["jpg", "png"],
  },
});

const upload = multer({ storage: storage });
```
